I also provide general management services to off-Broadway shows. In preparing myself for work in the theater, I studied extensively with some of Chicago's best know teachers/ directors. I have probably taken 30 or more courses in acting, directing, dance, and improvisation. I have also completed a significant amount of Coursework in producing at the commercial theater Institute in NY and a related program at the Eugene O'Neill center in ct. In parallel to my theater work, I taught and practiced finance. I hold an MBA in finance from the University of Chicago. Another relevant tangent to my theater experience is my work as a Gallerist in Chicago's West loop. My gallery Website can be found Online. I am also a graduate of the school of the art Institute of Chicago with a certificate in drawing., my background blends the creative drive of theater and art exhibition with the Hardcore ANALYTICS of finance and finance teaching. In addition to being a general manager and producer, I am also a former Finance lecturer at major universities and the owner of a contemporary art gallery. Thus I am proficient in driving projects, classes, and exhibitions to a successful conclusion. of course, these pursuits require substantial project management skill, relationship building, a willingness to get my hands dirty, time and financial budgeting, improvising of solutions to last minute problems, and a little bit of Charisma., general manager at greenhouse ensemble and associate producer at the triad, financier to Broadway and general manager, Robert bills group LLC, founder at Chappy& friends: bringing focus to animal welfare""]",,0,,
